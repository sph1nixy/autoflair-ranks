This feature allows users to award a bonus to be added to OP's score thus helping the user obtain a higher rank.
Make sure you enter a valid JSON as following:

```{ "!woo": {"rank1": 0, "rank2": 1, "mod": 10}, "!boo": {"rank1": 0, "rank2": -1, "mod": 10}, "!info": {"rank1": "info", "rank2": "info", "mod": "info"}}}```

**Karma Bonus Comment:**
Body of an automated comment to be added when a bonus keyword is used ```[Supported variables: ${user}, ${points}, ${karma}, ${totalExtra} and ${totalScore}]```

**Remove list:**
This is used clean up old ranks from flairs or to set a list of words to be removed entirely from the flair.
It must be defined as a JSON Array (Not a JSON Object):

```["oldRank1", "oldRank2", "prohibitedWord"]```

**Level Up Message Subject:**

**Exclude moderators:**
When enabled all subreddit moderators will be excluded from ranking and can set their own rank manually.

**Moderator rank:**
If set all subreddit moderators will persistently get this rank. Just enter the rank text (No JSON is needed).

## Notes

 - To retain flair color, You must define a unique flair css style under 
    **subreddit Settings** > **Look and Feel** > **User Flair** > **Edit flair** > Then Enable **CSS class name** and enter a unique class name
   
 - Any string you define as a rank title will be removed from existing user flairs and cannot be used by users anymore in their flair.
 - Adding a keword such as: "!info": ```{"rank1": "info", "rank2": "info", "mod": "info"}``` will allow users to query OP's points breakdown.
 - Custom emojis will work with this app, They have to be called as :emojiName: in the JSON as follows:

```{":Noob:": 0, ":Beginner:": 10, ":Advanced:": 100, ":Expert:": 1000, ":God-Like:": 10000}```

 - For any custom emoji to work in Reddit's user flairs you have to make sure you enable [User Flair] and  disable [Mod Only] from the custom emoji settings.
 - You need to make sure user flair is enabled for your subreddit for this app to work at all.
 - "Exclude moderators" will fully exit once a moderator permission is detected. Allowing each mod to set their custom rank individually.
 - "Moderator rank" will set a global rank for all mods that cannot be changed manually. You must disable "Exclude moderators" for this to work at all.
